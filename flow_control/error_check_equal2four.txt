    def equal_to_four(x)
      if x == 4
        puts "yup"
      else
        puts "nope"
    end

    equal_to_four(5)

    Why does the above code give an error, and how can it be fixed?
    Ans: The conditiional statement is missing and end keyword after the puts"nope" , add end there and it will fix the problem.
