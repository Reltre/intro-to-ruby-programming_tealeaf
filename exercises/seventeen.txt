Given:

hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

if hash1 == hash2
  puts "These hashes are the same!"
else
  puts "These hashes are not the same!"
end

What will this output:  This will output "These hashes are the same"
In a hash the order in which the key values pairs are stored does not matter, since you can directly access a value based on it's key.  It was only after Ruby 1.9 that hashes even rememberd the order in which kv pairs are stored.
