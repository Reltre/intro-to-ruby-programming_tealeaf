Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

The first hsah uses the symbol x, as the key for "some value"
The second hash uses the string stored in variable x as the key for "some value"
