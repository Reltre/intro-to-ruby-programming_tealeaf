names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'

And you get this error : TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

What is the problem and how can it be fixed? 
The problem is the user is trying to assign a value to the element 'margaret'.  Yet, they are not referencing the referece to this object correctly.  They would hava to names.index('margaret') or know the index where 'margaret' is stored in the array. So names names[3] = 'jody'
